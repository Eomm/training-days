## Overview - About Grafana

Hello, my name is Manuel and this is the Application Observability Demo

As you may know, Grafana is a powerful, open-source web application designed for interactive visualization and data correlation across multiple platforms.
It seamlessly integrates with a wide set of data sources, including Prometheus, allowing a user to query, visualize, and gain insights from applications metrics regardless of where they are stored.

---

Grafana empowers you to create, explore, and share dynamic dashboards with your team, fostering a data-driven culture. By breaking down silos and enabling faster, informed decision-making, it enhances collaboration and improves operational efficiency.

---

It creates a single pane of glass to monitor your infrastructure, applications, and business metrics and react proactively to events that may impact your business.

Right now the SRE team has received an alert from the monitoring system that the application is not working as expected. In today's demo, we will troubleshoot the issue and try to fix it using Grafana Cloud.

We have listed few improvements that can be done to avoid this issue in the future
such as connecting our Postgres database to Grafana Cloud to monitor the configuration and performance of our db and setting up new alerts.
